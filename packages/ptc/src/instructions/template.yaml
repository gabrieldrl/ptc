title: "Programmatic Tool Calling (PTC)"
description: "You can write TypeScript code that uses tools by importing them from \"/ptc/index\"."

toolCatalogPlaceholder: "{{toolCatalog}}"

examples:
  basic:
    description: "Example usage:"
    code: |
      // DO NOT include import statements - tools are already available
      const weather = await get_weather({ city: "london" });
      const sports = await get_sports_for_weather({ weather: weather });
      return { summary: `Weather: ${weather}, Sports: ${sports}` };

  loops:
    description: "Example with loops (properly formatted with all braces closed):"
    code: |
      const cities = ["london", "paris"];
      const results = [];

      for (const city of cities) {
        const weather = await get_weather({ city });
        const sports = await get_sports_for_weather({ weather: weather.weather });
        results.push({ city: weather.city, weather: weather.weather, sports: sports.sports });
      }

      return { results };

  multiple:
    description: "Example with multiple tool calls and proper structure:"
    code: |
      const city1 = "london";
      const city2 = "paris";

      const weather1 = await get_weather({ city: city1 });
      const weather2 = await get_weather({ city: city2 });

      const sports1 = await get_sports_for_weather({ weather: weather1.weather });
      const sports2 = await get_sports_for_weather({ weather: weather2.weather });

      return {
        city1: { weather: weather1.weather, sports: sports1.sports },
        city2: { weather: weather2.weather, sports: sports2.sports }
      };

criticalRules:
  title: "CRITICAL CODE STRUCTURE RULES"
  items:
    - "**ALWAYS close all opening braces** - Every opening brace { must have a matching closing brace }"
    - "**Check your code structure** - Count opening and closing braces before submitting"
    - "**Proper indentation** - Use 2 spaces for each level of nesting"
    - "**One statement per line** - Don't put multiple statements on one line"
    - "**Return statement** - Always include a return statement at the end"

importantNotes:
  title: "IMPORTANT"
  items:
    - "DO NOT include import statements in your code - the tools are already imported"
    - "DO NOT wrap your code in functions - just write the code directly"
    - "Your code should return a value (use 'return' statement)"
    - "Use await for async tool calls"
    - "FORMAT YOUR CODE WITH PROPER LINE BREAKS AND INDENTATION"
    - "DO NOT write everything on a single line - use multiple lines for readability"
    - "Each statement should be on its own line"
    - "Use proper indentation for blocks (functions, loops, conditionals)"
    - "**VERIFY ALL BRACES ARE CLOSED** - Missing braces will cause compilation errors"

footer: "When you need to use tools, write TypeScript code with proper formatting (multiple lines, proper indentation) and use the ptc_executor tool to execute it."
